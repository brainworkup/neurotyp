Leo demonstrated a balanced intellectual profile with no significant deviations from the norm relative to same-aged peers.

- **Acquired Knowledge**: Leo's level of acquired knowledge and verbal skills, as measured by the "Verbal Comprehension (VCI)" test, falls within the "High Average" range. This indicates that Leo's understanding of facts, vocabulary, and general knowledge is above average.

- **Fluid Reasoning**: Leo's nonverbal reasoning, as measured by the "General Ability (GAI)" test, falls within the "High Average" range. This suggests that Leo has a good ability to reason, problem-solve, and adapt to new situations or tasks.

- **General Intelligence**: Overall, Leo's general cognitive functioning, as measured by the "Full Scale IQ (FSIQ)" test, falls within the "High Average" range. This indicates that Leo should be able to manage well in typical day-to-day activities and perform at a level commensurate with their same-aged peers.


With regard to subtests within the WMI, the Picture Memory (PM) subtest required Charlie to
memorize pictures and identify them on subsequent pages. On the Zoo Locations (ZL) subtest, he memorized the location of animal cards on a map and then placed the cards in the same location. Charlie showed uneven performance on these tasks. When he viewed the location of animal cards and was
asked to place the cards in the correct location, his performance was above average for his age (ZL = 13) however, he showed greater difficulty remembering series of rapidly-presented pictures (PM = 8; PM < MSS-I, BR = 10%-25%; PM < ZL, BR = 8.2%). This pattern of strengths and weaknesses suggests that he may attend more easily to information during interactive tasks, or when information is supplemented by spatial cues.


- **Full Scale IQ**: The Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) composite score is derived from six subtests and summarizes ability across a diverse set of cognitive functions. This score is considered the most representative indicator of global intellectual functioning. Subtests are drawn from five areas of cognitive ability: verbal comprehension, fluid reasoning, visual-spatial ability, processing speed, and working memory. Charlie's FSIQ was measured in the Average range when compared to other children his age (FSIQ = 99, PR = 47, CI = 93-105). While the FSIQ provides a broad representation of cognitive functioning, describing Charlie's specific cognitive abilities provides a more thorough understanding of his current level of functioning. Some children perform at approximately the same level in all of these areas, but most children display areas of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

- **Verbal Comprehension**: The Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) measured Charlie's knowledge acquired from his environment, verbal concept formation, and verbal reasoning. Overall, Charlie's performance on subtests within the VCI was typical for his age but was an area of relative weakness compared to his overall level of ability (VCI = 90, PR = 25, Average range, CI = 84-97; VCI < MIS, BR = 5%-10%). His scores on verbal comprehension tasks were weaker than his performance on tasks that required him to figure things out by looking at them and use logic to solve problems (VCI < VSI, BR = 2.2%; VCI < FRI, BR = 11.1%). Additionally, his Verbal Comprehension performance was somewhat weaker than scores obtained on tasks requiring him to hold information in his mind (VCI < WMI, BR = 22.0%). Overall, verbal comprehension scores suggest that Charlie's verbal development is currently lagging in comparison to his development of visual spatial and logical reasoning skills and is an area for continued intervention.

With regard to individual subtests within the VCI, the Information (IN) subtest consists of general knowledge questions and the Similarities (SI) subtest required Charlie to identify similarities between common objects and concepts. He performed comparably across both subtests, suggesting that these verbal skills are similarly developed.
Relatively weak verbal skills are consistent with his reported difficulties with expressive and receptive language and may also contribute to his current difficulties with reading.

- **Visual Spatial**: Visual spatial processing involves organizing visual information, understanding part-whole relationships, attending to visual detail, and integrating visual and motor functions. During this evaluation, visual spatial processing was one of Charlie's strengths, with performance that was somewhat advanced for his age (VSI = 118, PR = 88, High Average range, CI = 107-125; VSI > MIS, BR = 2%-5%). Charlie quickly and accurately put together the pieces of puzzle-like tasks, and his performance in this area was particularly strong in relation to his performance on language-based tasks and logical reasoning tasks (VSI > VCI, BR = 2.2%; VSI > FRI, BR = 20.6%). Because his visual spatial skills currently appear stronger than his fluid reasoning skills, he may work easily with purely visual information, but have greater difficulty applying complex reasoning to visual stimuli. His visual spatial scores were also particularly strong when compared to his performance on working memory tasks and tests of processing speed (VSI > WMI, BR = 17.8%; VSI > PSI, BR = 4.4%). His relative strength in visual spatial skills compared to working memory skills suggests that at this time, he may show relative skill when processing visual information, but he may experience relative difficulty making distinctions between the visual information that he previously viewed, and the visual information that he is currently viewing.
The VSI consists of two tasks. On the Block Design (BD) subtest, Charlie viewed designs and used blocks to re-create each design. The Object Assembly (OA) subtest required him to assemble the pieces of puzzles to create pictures of common objects. Charlie showed uneven performance on these tasks. Putting together multicolored blocks to match pictures on Block Design was a strength for Charlie (BD = 16; BD > MSS-I, BR = 1%-2%). However, he showed greater difficulty on Object Assembly, in which he put together pictures of common objects (OA = 10; BD > OA, BR = 3.7%). This pattern of scores suggests that his ability to analyze and synthesize abstract visual information may be somewhat stronger than his ability to understand part-whole relationships and engage in trial-and-error learning.

- **Fluid Reasoning**
The Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI) measured Charlie's inductive reasoning skills, broad visual intelligence, simultaneous thinking, conceptual thinking, and classification ability. Overall, Charlie's performance on subtests within this index was typical for his age (FRI= 106, PR = 66, Average range, CI = 98-113). His performance on fluid reasoning tasks was particularly strong when compared to his performance on tasks that involved language-based skills (FRI > VCI, BR = 11.1%). Moreover, his overall performance on this index was stronger than performance on tasks that measured processing speed (FRI > PSI, BR = 21.7%). While Charlie's fluid reasoning performance during this assessment appeared stronger than some cognitive abilities, it was also weaker than others. His current performance evidenced difficulty with fluid reasoning tasks in relation to his performance on visual spatial tasks (FRI < VSI, BR = 20.6%).

The FRI consists of two subtests: Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts. Matrix Reasoning (MR) required Charlie to select the missing pieces in incomplete patterns. On Picture Concepts (PC), he was asked to choose pictures from two or three rows to form a group with a common trait. He performed comparably across both subtests, suggesting that his perceptual organization and categorical reasoning skills are similarly developed at this time.

- **Working Memory**: Working memory involves attention, concentration, and mental control. The WPPSI-IV Working Memory Index (WMI) measures specific aspects of working memory such as visual working memory, visual-spatial working memory, and ability to resist interference from previously memorized items. In the area of working memory, Charlie exhibited diverse performance on the WMI, but his overall performance was similar to other children his age (WMI = 103, PR = 58, Average range, CI = 95-111). Charlie showed average recall of series of pictures and locations of animal cards. His performance on these tasks was relatively strong compared to his performance on language based tasks (WMI > VCI, BR = 22.0%). While Charlie's performance on working memory tasks was stronger than some cognitive abilities, it was also somewhat weaker than others. Working memory performance was relatively low compared to his performance on visual spatial tasks (WMI < VSI, BR = 17.8%).


With regard to subtests within the WMI, the Picture Memory (PM) subtest required Charlie to
memorize pictures and identify them on subsequent pages. On the Zoo Locations (ZL) subtest, he memorized the location of animal cards on a map and then placed the cards in the same location. Charlie showed uneven performance on these tasks. When he viewed the location of animal cards and was
asked to place the cards in the correct location, his performance was above average for his age (ZL = 13) however, he showed greater difficulty remembering series of rapidly-presented pictures (PM = 8; PM < MSS-I, BR = 10%-25%; PM < ZL, BR = 8.2%). This pattern of strengths and weaknesses suggests that he may attend more easily to information during interactive tasks, or when information is supplemented by spatial cues.

**Processing Speed**: The Processing Speed Index (PSI) measured Charlie's ability to quickly and correctly scan or discriminate simple visual information. Charlie's performance across subtests in the PSI was diverse but overall was typical for his age (PSI = 94, PR = 34, Average range, CI = 85-104). When compared with his scores on visual spatial subtests, Charlie's performance on processing speed subtests was relatively weak (PSI < VSI, BR = 4.4%). Additionally, his processing speed scores appeared weak compared to his performance on tasks requiring him to use logic-based reasoning (PSI < FRI, BR = 21.7%).

The PSI consists of two subtests in which Charlie scanned pictures and marked target pictures with an ink dauber. During the Bug Search (BS) subtest, he marked pictures of bugs in a search group that matched the target bug. The Cancellation (CA) subtest required him to mark target objects in a random and structured array. Charlie demonstrated uneven performance across subtests within the PSI. He worked quickly when scanning an array of pictures to mark target objects (CA = 12). However, he showed greater difficulty on Bug Search, where his performance was weak in relation to his overall level of ability (BS = 6; BS < MSS-I, BR = 2%-5%; CA > BS, BR = 5.0%). This pattern of strengths and weaknesses suggests that he currently processes concrete, lifelike images more efficiently than abstract illustrations. His visual recognition skills may also be better developed than his visual short-term memory and visual discrimination skills.

- **Vocabulary Acquisition**: Charlie was administered the two subtests comprising the Vocabulary Acquisition Index (VAI), an ancillary index that provides a simpler, more focused measure of verbal abilities. His overall performance was slightly below other children his age (VAI = 83, PR = 13, Low Average range, CI = 77-91). His performance was similar on both tasks, which required him to point to pictures that best represented words read aloud, and to name objects in pictures (RV = 7; PN = 7). These scores suggest that his expressive and receptive language abilities are similarly developed. His somewhat weak performance on VAI subtests is consistent with his reported receptive and expressive language difficulties. His performance may also have been impacted by receptive language difficulties observed during testing.

- **Nonverbal Index**: The Nonverbal Index (NVI) is derived from five subtests that do not require verbal responses. This index can provide a measure of general intellectual functioning that minimizes language demands for children with special clinical needs such as speech and language problems. Subtests in this index are drawn from the Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed scales. Charlie's performance on the NVI fell in the Average range when compared to other children his age (NVI = 103, PR = 58, CI = 97-109). 

- **General Ability**: Charlie was administered the four subtests comprising the General Ability Index (GAI), an ancillary index that provides an estimate of general intelligence that is less sensitive to the influence of working memory and processing speed difficulties than FSIQ. The GAI consists of subtests from the visual spatial, fluid reasoning, and verbal domains. His overall performance on this index was similar to other children his age (GAI = 108, PR = 70, Average range, CI = 101-114). His GAI score was significantly higher than his FSIQ score (GAI > FSIQ, BR = 3.2%).

- **Cognitive Proficiency**: Charlie was also administered the Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI), which consists of four subtests drawn from the working memory and processing speed domains. His performance on this Index suggests that he exhibits average efficiency when processing cognitive information in the service of learning, problem solving, and higher-order reasoning (CPI = 98, PR = 45, Average range, CI = 91-106). Charlie's performance on subtests contributing to the GAI was significantly stronger than his overall level of cognitive proficiency (GAI > CPI, BR = 22.8%).
The significant difference between Charlie's GAI and FSIQ indicates that the contributions of working memory and processing speed may have led to a lower overall FSIQ. Relative weaknesses in mental control and speed of visual scanning may sometimes create challenges as he engages in more complex cognitive processes, such as learning new material or applying logical thinking skills. This pattern of cognitive functioning is consistent with his attention problems.
