## Examiner Qualifications

I'm fortunate to have a blend of scientific and clinical experience in this field, with a solid academic foundation comprising four psychology degrees (BA, MA, MPhil, and PhD), and specialized training in clinical neuropsychology. My journey includes an APA-accredited predoctoral internship in pediatric clinical neuropsychology at Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, and a postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric genetics at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NIH.

Previously, I've served as the Director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Genomics, Assistant Investigator of Psychiatric Neuroscience, and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital and Hofstra Northwell Health School of Medicine, New York. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. Earlier this year, I was honored with the Della Martin Assistant Professor of Psychiatry position at the Keck School of Medicine, an acknowledgment of my research and clinical contributions to both the university and the wider scientific community.

In my clinical role, I've garnered over 20 years of experience in neurocognitive and psychodiagnostic evaluations, specializing in ADHD across all ages. I've conducted numerous neuropsychological and psychoeducational assessments, particularly in ADHD and learning disorders. As a researcher, I am actively involved and NIH-funded, having contributed to pivotal studies on cognitive aspects of neurodevelopment in ADHD. One of our notable publications, which was recognized as a "must read" by Faculty of 1000 Medicine, highlighted the link between ADHD and early subcortical dysfunction, and how symptom recovery correlates with executive control and prefrontal cortex maturation.

With this background, I believe I bring a unique, objective, and evidence-based perspective to the evaluation and diagnosis of patients, considering their genetic and developmental histories.

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive
performance assessed during this examination is summarized above.
Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included.
Cultural considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations.
Results from formal tests are reported in comparison to other individuals the
same age and sex/gender as range of functioning (e.g., below
average, average, above average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and
necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a
normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or
treatment recommendations.

## Conversion of Test Scores

  render: (columns: auto, ..args) => {
    tablex(
      columns: (auto, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr),
      auto-lines: false,
      align: (col, row) => 
            if row == 0 { center + horizon }
            else if col == 0 { left + horizon }
            else { center + horizon },

## Test Score Distributions

**[@fig-gauss-plot-narrow]** can be used as a guide to help interpret individual test scores in terms of the degree of distance a score fell in relation to normative expectations and the magnitude of clinical severity. Test scores are easiest to interpret as percentiles[^1] and as *z*-Scores (M = 0, SD = 1)[^2], which are used to plot the various test and domain scores below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gauss-plot-narrow
#| fig-cap: "Classification of neuropsychological test scores that are normally distributed in the general population [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]."
#| fig-retina: 2
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.67
#| out-height: 50%

[^1]: A *percentile* shows `r params$first_name`'s standing relative to peers. For example, a percentile rank of 70 means `r params$first_name` performed as well as or better than 70% of individuals the same age.

[^2]: *z-Score* = -1 (16th percentile), *z-Score* = 0 (50th percentile), and
*z-Score* = +1 (84th percentile)
