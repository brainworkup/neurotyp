Based on interpretation of parent reports completed by Mrs. Smalls,
Biggie's mother, Biggie exhibits clinically significant hyperactivity,
suggesting she has difficulty managing behavior in structured settings. She also
struggles with maintaining attention at home and school, potentially affecting
her academic performance and other functional areas of life. Occasional unusual
or disconnected behaviors indicated by her Atypicality score could interfere
with her academic engagement and social relationships, possibly signaling
underlying cognitive processing issues and contributing to feelings of
isolation. Her Withdrawal score suggests challenges in social integration, which
could decrease academic participation, distract from learning, and lead to
loneliness. Significant concerns have been expressed about her Adaptive Skills,
particularly in Social Skills, Leadership, Activities of Daily Living, and
Functional Communication, indicating potential struggles with social
integration, daily functioning, and communication.
