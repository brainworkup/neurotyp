Biggie's observer ratings, completed by his father, Kool Moe Dee, indicate a range of symptoms. His DSM-5 Hyperactive-Impulsive and ADHD Symptoms were assessed as Above Average, demonstrating behavior consistent with ADHD presentations. His Hyperactivity/Restlessness, Inattentive Symptoms, and Inattention/Memory Problems were rated as High Average, indicating issues such as restlessness, fidgeting, and trouble concentrating. He also showed High Average ratings in areas related to self-concept and 'at-risk' indicators for ADHD. His Impulsivity and Emotional Lability were rated as Average. However, his ratings were Low Average for Emotion Regulation, Inhibitory Control, Planning, and Attention, suggesting challenges in managing emotions, controlling impulses, and maintaining focus. His overall level of executive functioning, Flexibility, Organization, and Working Memory were rated as Below Average, suggesting difficulties in tasks such as decision-making, adjusting behavior, organization, and memory retention.

Observer ratings indicate that Biggie exhibits a range of ADHD symptoms and challenges in executive functioning. His behavior is consistently in line with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for both Hyperactive-Impulsive and Combined Presentation of ADHD, with ratings for these categories being Above Average. This suggests that he may struggle to control his impulses and maintain focus across different tasks, potentially affecting his efficiency in a variety of contexts such as work or school. His Hyperactivity/Restlessness and Inattentive Symptoms ratings are High Average, indicating that he may have difficulty staying on task for extended periods and may be more restless or easily distracted than others.

Furthermore, his composite indicator for identifying individuals potentially 'at-risk' for ADHD, along with his scores for Inattention/Memory Problems and Problems with Self-Concept, are also High Average. This implies that he might have issues with concentration, task completion, forgetfulness, disorganization, as well as potential struggles with social relationships, self-esteem, and self-confidence. These challenges could make it more difficult for him to form and maintain positive relationships, both personally and professionally.

Moreover, his Low Average ratings in Emotion Regulation, Inhibitory Control, Planning, Attention, and Self-Monitoring could suggest struggles in managing emotions, thinking before acting, devising strategies for tasks, avoiding distractions, and evaluating his behavior. This could potentially result in him finding it difficult to stay calm during small problems, acting without considering consequences, struggling to plan and make good decisions, and having trouble recognizing when a different approach is required.

His overall level of observer-reported executive functioning was determined to be Below Average, with his Flexibility and Organization ratings also falling into this category. This indicates potential struggles in adjusting his behavior based on changing circumstances and managing his personal effects, work, and time effectively. These challenges could impact his ability to adapt to new situations, meet deadlines, and maintain an organized living or working space.
