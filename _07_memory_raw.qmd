<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to learning
and memory. For scores that are Below
Average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are
Above Average to Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.
