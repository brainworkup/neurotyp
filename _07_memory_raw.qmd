# Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores as if you are an experienced clinical neuropsychologist. For scores that are below average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily life and functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation from scores that are above average to below average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses.

Performance on a more complex one-trial verbal learning and recall task (story learning) was High Average. 
Delayed recall of the story details over time was High Average. 
Learning and recognition of visual material (abstract shapes) was High Average. 
Recall of the list after a long (20-minute) delay was Average. 
Recall of the list after a long (20-minute) delay with cues was Average. 
Recognition of the target visual material among nontarget distractors after a delay period was Average. 
Recall of the list after a short delay was Average. 
The percentage of story detail retained over time, scaled to how much was initially learned fell in the Average range. 
Spontaneous, long-term delayed recall (20-25 min) recall and reproduction of a complex abstract figure fell within the Average range. 
Yes/no recognition discriminability was Average. 
Percentage of visual detail retained over time, scaled to how much was initially learned fell in the Average range. 
Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was Low Average.
