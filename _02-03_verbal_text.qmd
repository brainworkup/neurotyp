Mr. Lopez evidenced a range of abilities in verbal skills, with particular strengths in naming and verbal reasoning. However, there were significant challenges in auditory comprehension, letter fluency, and to a lesser extent, category fluency.

- **Retrieval**: Average ability in naming, indicating he is typically able to recall and name familiar objects or concepts. This skill is important for everyday communication and interaction.

- **Reasoning**: Average verbal reasoning (Similarities), which indicates an adequate ability to understand and express relationships between different concepts. This skill is crucial for effective communication and understanding complex ideas.

- **Fluency**: Low Average semantic fluency, which suggests some difficulty in generating words within a given category. This affects his ability to quickly retrieve and articulate words related to specific topics, which might be noticeable in conversational speech or specific tasks like brainstorming. His below-average score in phonemic fluency indicates difficulties in generating words that start with a specific letter. This impacts tasks requiring quick word retrieval based on phonemic cues, such as thinking of names or items in rapid succession. Such patterns are typical in individuals with dyslexia.

- **Comprehension**: Exceptionally Low score, which signifies challenges in understanding spoken language. This impacts daily communication, understanding instructions, or following verbal directions.
