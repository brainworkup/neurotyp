Biggie showed particularly strong performance on tests measuring working memory capacity and higher cognitive reasoning, both of which ranked in the Exceptionally High and Above Average ranges respectively. Other estimates of her verbal and visual memory functioning, crystallized intelligence, language comprehension, and premorbid verbal ability level all fell within the Above Average range. These scores suggest that Biggie is highly versatile with regards to her cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of working memory capacity, higher cognitive reasoning, and verbal/visual memory functioning.

However, attentional function and aggregate performance across metrics of processing speed and cognitive efficiency were categorized as Average. This may pose challenges in her ability to concentrate on tasks, retain instructions, or attend to intricate details. Relative deficiencies in these areas may suggest difficulties in managing time-sensitive tasks or demonstrating self-discipline in routine activities. Such factors could result in challenges when undertaking complex work tasks necessitating efficient multitasking, as well as subtler impairments such as difficulty staying focused during conversations.
