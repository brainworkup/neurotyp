# NEUROBEHAVIORAL STATUS EXAM {#nse}

## Notification/Informed Consent

Mr. Smalls consented to undergo the current neuropsychological evaluation. He was informed
nothing we discussed would remain confidential, and information he provided
during our meetings and the test results from my evaluation of him would become
a part of my report, to be used at his attorney's discretion.
He was informed a copy of any report I produced would be sent to his attorney, possibly to the prosecuting attorney, and to the court.
Mr. Smalls indicated having understood the purpose of the evaluation and the
limitations of confidentiality of our interviews and the testing I conducted.

This report is based on a review of available information contained in medical
records and criminal records, video surveillance, as well as interviews with Mr.
Smalls, his father Big Daddy Kane, his attorney Johnny Cochrane, and information gathered during multiple days of evaluation. I reserve the
right to change my opinions about the following should I be provided additional
records that alter my understanding of the findings. Please note my current
employer, Keck School of Medicine of USC, is neither involved nor affiliated
with this case, and that the patient was referred to me by his attorney's
office.

## Reason for Referral

Biggie Smalls is a 16-year-old, right-handed male with 12 years of education.
He was referred for forensic neuropsychological and psychodiagnostic
evaluation to elucidate the nature and extent of neurocognitive
sequelae resulting from a history of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD). The evaluation is necessary in determining if ADHD was a contributing
factor in his involvement in X, Y, and Z.

The current evaluation was initiated to document any objectively-derived neurocognitive impairments Mr. Smalls may have, or to confirm their absence. Upon the completion of the evaluation, Mr. Smalls and his attorney have the right to pursue mental health diversion based on the findings.

## Forensic Case Formulation

Biggie Smalls was in a collision with another
vehicle at a Brooklyn, NY intersection. Smalls, trying to drive through a
light turning red, hit a vehicle making a left turn. Both drivers' views were
blocked by stopped cars, preventing each from visually identifying the other
until it was too late to react. Upon collision, the second vehicle spun counter-clockwise
and its driver, not seatbelted, was ejected into the street and lost consciousness. Smalls's
vehicle veered and hit a traffic signal post.

### Family History

Mr. Smalls experienced an unstable childhood, marked by frequent relocations and shifting parental care. He spent time living with his mother in various locations including XX. Notably, his grandmother played a key role in managing his Type 1 diabetes and providing care during his mother's work hours. He was energetic and impulsive as a child, and found positive outlets in karate and music, supported by his mother. However, school was extremely challenging, and he was expelled from elementary school due to behavioral issues.

### Psychiatric History

From a young age, Mr. Smalls had to meticulously manage his blood sugar levels,
which, along with an unstable home life and frequent school changes, resulted in
chronic feelings of uncertainty, alienation, and shame. He developed an
intense anxiety towards authority figures due to disciplinary
issues stemming from his struggles with ADHD and disruptive behavioral symptoms. He continues to struggle
with episodes of depression and chronically has anxiety.


### Educational History

In elementary school and middle school, Mr. Smalls faced academic struggles,
behavioral issues, and frequent moves. He had difficulty with fourth-grade math
and risked retention. He had a 504 Plan for XX, and so the school also advised
an ADHD evaluation to address his learning and behavioral needs. He received
after school supports for a period of time but still continued to struggle.
Despite the seriousness of his behavioral
and learning issues, Mr. Smalls's parents' skepticism towards therapy and
medication prevented him from receiving consistent mental health interventions during his youth.

He attended at least three high schools before dropping out for full-time work.
Struggling with two part-time jobs, he returned to school, securing his diploma
from an alternative high school. In contrast, his three brothers excelled
academically, all graduating from college.
