Mr. Lopez demonstrated a range of performance across different memory tasks.

## Learning vs. Recall

- **Learning Efficiency**: High average performance in learning and immediate recognition of visual material (abstract shapes). Low average performance in complex one-trial verbal learning (story learning).

- **Delayed Recall**: Average performance in recalling verbal lists after a delay with cues and in recognizing visual material after a delay. Notable weaknesses in the delayed recall of complex verbal and visual material.

## Types of Memory

### Rote Memory (List Learning)

- Average abilities in both learning and recalling lists of information after short and long delays, suggesting adequate rote memory skills.

### Contextual Memory (Story/Narrative Memory)

- **Immediate Recall**: Low average abilities in learning and recalling story details immediately.

- **Delayed Recall**: Continued low average abilities in recalling story details over time, indicating difficulties with contextual memory.

### Visual Memory (Figure Recall)

- **Immediate Recognition**: High average capabilities in learning and recognizing abstract shapes immediately.

- **Delayed Recognition**: Average abilities in recognizing target visual material among distractors after a delay.

- **ROCFT Delayed Recall**: Below-average performance in spontaneously recalling and reproducing a complex abstract figure after a long-term delay, suggesting difficulties with visual memory retention.
