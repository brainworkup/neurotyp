# APPENDIX

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive
performance assessed during this neuropsychological evaluation is summarized
above. Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included. Cultural
considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and
making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Results from formal tests are
reported in comparison to other individuals the same age, sex, and educational
level as range of functioning (e.g., below average, average, above average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions
of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted
within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and
necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a
normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or
treatment recommendations.

## Conversion of Test Scores

```{r}
#| label: ranges
#| eval: true
#| cache: true
#| double-escape: true
#| escape: false

range <- readr::read_csv("test_score_ranges.csv")
tbl_range <- gt::gt(range) |>
  gt::tab_header(title = "Test Score Labels/Ranges") |>
  gt::cols_align(align = "center") |>
  gtExtras::gt_theme_538()
gt::gtsave(tbl_range, glue::glue("tbl_range", ".png"))
