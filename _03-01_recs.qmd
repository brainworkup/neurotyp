# RECOMMENDATIONS {#sec-recs} 

## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- Treatment options for ADHD include a combination of behavioral techniques, consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic condition. `r params$first_name` may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of `r params$his_her` symptoms is indicated with one of our psychiatrists.

- *Psychotherapy* Individual therapy to address features of anxiety, heightened stress, ward off any emerging depression, and to instill adaptive coping skills. Mindfulness, distress tolerance skills, and cognitive-behavioral techniques should be woven into the therapeutic process.

## Recommendations for School/High Stakes Exams

- *Accommodated testing* Given her weakness in processing speed, extended time accommodations for high-stakes exams (e.g., BAR EXAM) in particular are apt to more readily enable `r params$first_name` to demonstrate `r params$his_her` competencies in a more effective and consistent manner, given `r params$his_her` weakness in processing speed. Further, additional test taking time will enable `r params$first_name` to identify and utilize organizational strategies and allay feelings of anxiety that accompany time-intensive tasks to channel `r params$his_her` skills in the most effective manner.

- *Classroom recordings* `r params$first_name` should be provided with lecture notes/slides prior to class for advanced preparation and review and be allowed to audio or video record the lecture for later review.
