## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive performance assessed during this neuropsychological evaluation is summarized above.
Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included.
Cultural considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations.
Results from formal tests are reported in comparison to other individuals the same age, sex, and educational level as range of functioning (e.g., below average, average, above average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Conversion of Test Scores

```{r}
#| label: ranges
#| eval: true
#| cache: true
#| double-escape: true
#| escape: false
range <- readr::read_csv("test_score_ranges.csv")
tbl_range <- gt::gt(range) |>
  gt::tab_header(title = "Test Score Labels/Ranges") |>
  gt::cols_align(align = "center") |>
  gtExtras::gt_theme_538()
gt::gtsave(tbl_range, glue("tbl_range", ".png"))
knitr::include_graphics("tbl_range.png")
```
