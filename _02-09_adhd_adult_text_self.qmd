The patient's Full Scale executive function score is significantly below average at the 1st percentile. This indicates pervasive weaknesses across multiple cognitive and behavioral domains. Specifically, the patient's Attention scale falls at the 1st percentile, aligning with identified executive function weaknesses. Emotion Regulation abilities are low and rank at the 10th percentile. Flexibility, Organization, and Planning are particularly weak, each falling well below average at the 2nd and 1st percentiles respectively. Inhibitory Control and Initiation are also below average at the 4th and 6th percentiles, respectively. Self-Monitoring and Working Memory rank in the below-average range at the 2nd and 3rd percentiles. This profile indicates significant challenges in executive functioning, including attention, flexibility, planning, and memory.

The patient's self-report from the CAARS highlight significant difficulties in areas related to ADHD. Inattention and Memory Problems, scoring at the 82nd percentile, suggest significant issues with concentration, planning, task completion, forgetfulness, and disorganization. Hyperactivity/Restlessness, at the 72nd percentile, indicates problems with maintaining focus on tasks, restlessness, and fidgeting. The Impulsivity/Emotional Lability scale, at the 74th percentile, suggests challenges with impulsive behaviors, low frustration tolerance, and mood fluctuations. Problems with Self-Concept, scoring at the 66th percentile, indicate moderately atypical issues with social relationships and self-esteem.

In the DSM-5 related scores, Inattentive Symptoms are markedly atypical, at the 98th percentile, consistent with the Inattentive Presentation of ADHD. Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms, at the 77th percentile, also display marked atypicality, in line with the Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation of ADHD. The overall score for DSM-5 ADHD Symptoms is at the 96th percentile, suggestive of behavior meeting the Combined Presentation of ADHD criteria. The ADHD Index is at the 77th percentile, indicating a significant risk for ADHD. The Inconsistency Index score of 6 implies that the results are probably valid.
